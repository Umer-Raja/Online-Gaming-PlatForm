# Online-Gaming-Platform

The gaming industry has seen a significant rise in recent years, with more and more people engaging in online gaming as a source of entertainment. With this growth, the demand for new and innovative games has also increased, leading to an opportunity for game developers to showcase their skills and creativity. However, building and distributing games can be a challenging task, especially for independent developers who lack resources and a platform to reach a wider audience.
To address this challenge, we had proposed an online gaming platform that allows users to play games and upload their own game builds to generate revenue. The platform has been built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), a popular and efficient technology stack for developing modern web applications. With this platform, game developers can showcase their skills and creativity by building and publishing games and earn revenue by Adds, while users can play games and discover new titles. This model incentivizes developers to build quality games, while also providing users with a wider range of games to choose from.
